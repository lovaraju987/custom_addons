# KPI Tracking Module - Final Validation Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Group Type Field Addition
- Added `group_type` field (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) to `kpi.report.group` model
- Updated all related views, demo data, and migration scripts
- Synced KPI `report_type` with group type and added 'yearly' option

### 2. Employee KPI Integration
- Created `hr_employee_kpi.py` to extend `hr.employee` with computed fields:
  - `assigned_kpis`: Many2many field linking to KPIs
  - `kpi_count`: Count of assigned KPIs
  - `total_kpi_achievement`: Average achievement percentage
  - `kpi_score_label`: Performance level (Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement, Poor)
  - `kpi_score_color`: Color coding for performance levels
  - `recent_kpi_submissions`: KPI submissions from last 30 days

### 3. Employee View Extensions
- Extended employee form view with KPI information tab
- Updated employee tree view with KPI columns
- Enhanced employee kanban view with KPI badges
- Added employee search filters for KPI performance

### 4. Odoo 17 Compatibility Fixes
- Removed deprecated `attrs` attribute from all views
- Fixed invisible conditions using proper syntax
- Added search methods for computed fields to avoid "unsearchable field" errors
- Simplified search and action domains
- Fixed XML syntax errors and view inheritance issues
- **FIXED: Kanban view inheritance** - Updated to use correct external ID `hr.hr_kanban_view_employees`

### 5. Data and Migrations
- Updated demo data to assign users to KPIs for testing
- Created migration scripts for new fields (17.4.6 and 17.4.7)
- Used direct SQL in migrations to avoid Odoo API issues
